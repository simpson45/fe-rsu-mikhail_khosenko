	Prime is inspired by the great pizza makers of NYC at places like Di Fara, Patsy's and Best. Our goal is simple: to bring truly great NY-style pizza to our hometown of Los Angeles. We start our dough with the highest quality AP and 00 flour, then let it ferment for a full 48 hours to develop that true, homemade flavor. After that, we stretch it by hand, top it with local, California tomatoes and all-natural Grande mozzarella from Wisconsin. No fillers. No gimmicks. Just pizza.
